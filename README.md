Cogni is a powerful learning tool to help students study in new, adaptive ways.
We provide two main types of learning tools, flashcards and interactive tests. All materials are rendered in HTML/CSS/JS and API calls to OpenAI are all done through JS.
Our site provides a level of interactability not possible through traditional methods of learning, and we provide a higher degree of interactability than your typical AI chatbot.
Our original repo has not been included to protect our privacy, and our API keys have all been removed.
